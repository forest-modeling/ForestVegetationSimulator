Subject: Event Monitor activity expansion

Name: Lance David

Date: 04/18/2025

Variants affected: All

Description: Expanded the number of activities the Event Monitor can handle. The number of
             activities that can be scheduled and executed in a single cycle has not been
             changed, only the total number of activities that can be done for a complete
             projection. Projections that reported "FVS10 ERROR:  OPTION/ACTIVITY STORAGE
             AREA IS FULL" may still generate this error but the projection will succeed
             for additional cycles. The number of additional cycles will depend on the
             specific events or activities that are involved in a single cycle.

Impact on users: Performance of events and activities for additional cycles.

common\OPCOM.F77 - Increased MAXACT from 2000 to 4000 and MAXPRM from 5999 to 7999.
                   MAXPRM cannot be increased further due to constraints with hard coded
                   value ranges for variable INSTR in evldx.f

base\evldx.f - Changed upper limit range for INSTR from 7000 to 9000 at line 74.
               To increase this value any further interferes with other processing as INSTR
               is used to determine what kind of instruction of performed.
